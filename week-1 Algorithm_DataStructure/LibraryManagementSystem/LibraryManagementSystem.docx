Search Algorithm Basics

1. Linear Search:
   - Scans each item in sequence.
   - No need for sorting.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)

2. Binary Search:
   - Requires sorted data.
   - Uses divide-and-conquer strategy.
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)

When to Use:
- Linear Search: Small or unsorted data.
- Binary Search: Large, sorted data for faster lookup.

Search Algorithms Implemented:
1. Linear Search:
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - No sorting needed
   - Simpler, less efficient for large datasets

2. Binary Search:
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)
   - Requires sorted array
   - Faster for large datasets

Conclusion:
- Binary search is preferred when working with sorted books and larger libraries.
- Linear search is acceptable for smaller or frequently updated book lists.
